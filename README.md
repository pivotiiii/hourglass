## Hourglass Changes

### Installer

- Adds the **Hourglass** executable path to the [Windows App Paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/app-registration#using-the-app-paths-subkey), so the **Hourglass** [command-line](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/blob/develop/Hourglass/Resources/Usage.txt) is available out of the box.

- The **Command-line usage** dialog can be accessed from the **About** dialog and vice versa.

- The timer window pops up on the current virtual desktop.
- The sound file can be placed to the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hourglass` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hourglass\Sounds` directories. It can be the symbolic link created by the `mklink` system command.

- The **Resume all** timer window context menu command resumes all the paused timers. Command-line command is `resume`

### Misc

- The **Hourglass** is built deterministically using the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/i2van/hourglass/actions).

## Troubleshooting

If the **Hourglass** does not start or fails silently, delete the **Hourglass** settings.

The **Hourglass** settings can be located by the following command (to run it press `Win+R` and copy-paste command below):

```shell
cmd /k dir "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Chris_Dziemborowicz*"
```

The settings are stored into the corresponding `hourglass.EXE` subdirectories.

The **Hourglass Portable** keeps settings next to the executable.
